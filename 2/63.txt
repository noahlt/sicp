Example set: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}

Example trees:

    7
   / \
  3   9
 / \   \
1   5   11

'(1 3 5 7 9 11)


  3
 / \
1   7
   / \
  5   9
       \
        11

'(1 3 5 7 9 11)


     5
    / \
   3   9
  /   / \
 1   7   11

'(1 3 5 7 9 11)

The two procedures always produce the same list, given the same
tree. While both procedures take the same number of steps (O(n)) to
convert a given tree to a list, tree->list-2 is tail-recursive and
therefore takes slightly less memory.
