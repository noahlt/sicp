Louis’ implementation works one way: if you set a, it will produce the squared value, b.  But the entire point of a constraint propagator is to work both ways.  A proper implementation of a squarer would also allow you to set b and get a = √b, which Louis’ implementation does not do.  This is because it is implemented in terms of multiplier, which does not know about squarer’s constraint that its two factors must be equal.
