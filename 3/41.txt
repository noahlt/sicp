Ben is wrong.  The procedure he serialized is defined as:

    (lambda () balance)

It only has one operation: looking up the value of balance.  The class
of error that serialization eliminates is that of the different operations
across procedures being inteleaved.  When there's only one operation in
a procedure, other procedure's operations cannot possibly be inteleaved
within its operations, since there is only one.  So serializing a single
operation has no effect.

(Nice try, though.  I had the same thought when I first saw the serialized
version of make-account.)
