(define (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
  ((to-account 'deposit) amount))

This transfer procedure does not require the sophisticated serialization
we had to do with the balance swap procedure.  The account swap procedure
had to set new balances as a function of old balances to the same accounts,
and errors in the procedure occurred when one process set a new value in
between another process' reading and writing values.  But the transfer
procedure withdraws from one account and deposits to another account.  Since
it never sets a balance which was calculated as a function of an old balance
to the same account, there is no possibility of another procedure causing
an error by setting a new balance after the transfer procedure has performed
its read operation.
