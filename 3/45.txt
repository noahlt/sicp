The serializer doesn’t let any two procedures with the same serializer run at the same time.  Our implementation of serialized-exchange calls exchange, which sends the ‘withdraw and ‘deposit messages to the accounts.  If each account’s withdraw and deposit methods are also serialized, then serialized-exchange won’t be able to call them.  (According to the serializer implementation later in the chapter, serialized-exchange will actually just run forever, waiting for itself to release the mutex.)
