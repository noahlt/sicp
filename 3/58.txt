(define (expand num den radix)
  (cons-stream
    (quotient (* num radix) den)
    (expand (remainder (* num radix) den) den radix)))

Below is a table of successive calls to expand, starting with the initial call and followed by calls from the cdr position of cons-stream.  The right column is the value produced in the stream (the value passed to the car position of cons-stream) for that call to expand:

Successive calls   Value in
to expand          stream

(expand 1 7 10) -> 1
(expand 3 7 10) -> 4
(expand 2 7 10) -> 2
(expand 6 7 10) -> 8
(expand 4 7 10) -> 5

And the same for the other provide expression:

Successive calls   Value in
to expand          stream

(expand 3 8 10) -> 3
(expand 6 8 10) -> 7
(expand 4 8 10) -> 5
(expand 0 8 10) -> 0
(expand 0 8 10) -> 0

This stream produces the positional approximation in the given radix of a division between two integers.
