I donâ€™t want to draw another environment diagram, but the gist is:

for-each-except is evaluated in the following stack of contexts:

  set-my-value (local scope)
    vars: newval, setter
  context created by let in make-connector
    vars from args: value, informant, constraints
  context of call to make-connector
    vars from args: none
    vars from local defines: set-my-value, forget-my-value, connect, me
  global context:
    inform-about-value, forget-about-value, constant, probe, make-connector, etc.
