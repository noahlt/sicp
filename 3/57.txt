Memoized and unmemoized Fibonacci streams are just the same as iterative and recursive Fibonacci functions from chapter 2.  With the memoized streams, all previously-calculated Fibonacci numbers are available in the memoized values, so we get the same number of addition operations as we get derived Fibonacci numbers (which is to say, excepting 0 and 1 which are defined) â€” so with the memoized stream the number of addition operations grows with the number of Fibonacci numbers computed.  With the unmemoized stream, each new call to (stream-cdr fibs) needs to calculate the next value for (stream-car fibs) by recomputing two streams (for Fib(n-1) and Fib(n-2)), each of which has to compute two more streams, leading to an exponential number of addition operations.
