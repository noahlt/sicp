(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))

1 2 4 8 16 31 ...

Each next element is generated by adding the previous element to itself—by doubling it.

Incidentally, while I love the conceptual power of defining recursive streams, I wonder whether there’s a better notation.  Mathematical sequences have a good notation:

  Fib(0) = 0
  Fib(1) = 1
  Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)

Maybe people don’t use streams so much in code because the notation is clunky.
